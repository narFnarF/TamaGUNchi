::test des silently pour la macro du gars
<<set $c = 1>>
Now the value of $c is <<print $c>> (1).

Test single level silently: <<silently>>
<<if $c = 1>
<<set $c = $c + 1>>
<<else>>
This should not display,
<<endif>>
This should not display2
<<endsilently>>Now the value of $c is <<print $c>> (2). (Should be one line)

Test 2-level nested silently: <<silently>><<silently>>
<<set $c = $c + 1>>

<<endsilently>>
<<if $c = 3>>
<<set $c = $c + 1>>
<<else>>
This should not display,
<<endif>>
This should not display1 - after first endsilently
This should not display1 - after first endsilently
This should not display1 - after first endsilently
<<endsilently>> Now the value of $c is <<print $c>> (4). (Should be one line)

Let's go a bit nuts with the levels (.(.)(((.))(.))): <<silently>>
<<set $c = $c + 1>>
<<silently>><<set $c = $c + 1>><<endsilently>>
<<silently>><<silently>><<silently>>
<<set $c = $c + 1>>
<<endsilently>><<endsilently>>
<<silently>>
<<set $c = $c + 1>>
<<endsilently>><<endsilently>>
<<endsilently>> Now the value of $c is <<print $c>> (8). (Should be one line)
